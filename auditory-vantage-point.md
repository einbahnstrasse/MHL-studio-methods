## Deadline: Week 3: {{ site.week-03 }}  

### What To Do   

Write down **2 detailed lists of 50 sounds each** documenting what you hear by following the guidelines below.  
**Send me an email** with your lists by the deadline.     

### How to Do It     

From a single listening position inside your home, sit quietly and observe the sounds around you.   

Concentrate hard, shifting your attention actively.  

Try as best as you can to **identify each sound** and **identify its “source” (where the sound comes from)** relative to your listening position. 

#### Consider the following...     

* Which sounds seem to change over time?
* Which sounds are unchanging?   
* Which sounds have their own internal movement?   
* Do any of your sounds mimic musical elements? Chords, arpeggios, melodies, rhythms, instruments, white noise?   
* Do any of your sounds seem to be working together?   
* Can you hear distant locations?  
* Are any of the sounds from very large sources? Very small?    

Feel free to make notes on any observations that answer these questions or others that interest you, but don't feel obligated to write too much!  

Identifying the first 25 sounds will be easy. After that, the next 15 will get progressively more difficult, and the last 10 will be almost impossible. Push yourself... For example, if you hear 2 cars go by, what makes each of them sound different? If it's the sound of people talking, ignore the words and describe the sound of their voices.  

### Why Do This??  

The human brain ignores more than 80% of the sounds around us.  

It does this in order to focus on a single task at hand.  

That means becoming an expert listener is all about learning to actively turn on + off this selective perception.
