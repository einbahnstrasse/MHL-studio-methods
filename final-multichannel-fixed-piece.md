## Deadline: Week 13: {{ site.week-13 }}  

The final is a complete piece (_recommended: 8-12 minutes in duration_) for fixed media, in <strike>8-channel</strike> 4-channel surround sound. 

This piece will be featured during the _**Werkstatt für Aktuelle Musik**_ (January 17-20, 2024).  

You are encouraged (but not required) to use your midterm “sketch” as a basis for your final piece.  

Of course, you can choose to treat the final as an entirely separate piece, but the option to use your midterm as a “miniature” version of your final piece is given.   

It would be an efficient use of time to expand upon the ideas you presented in your midterm, or somehow make use of the work you did there. Supplement this new mixing, multichannel, and MaxMSP techniques that you continued to learn since Week 6. Revise automation or record new sounds, etc.  

By the deadline, send me a Reaper project folder (by email, WeTransfer.com, or any cloud link), and a stereo mixdown (binaural), meeting the following criteria:  

### Criteria   

The final exam piece should address similar criteria from the midterm exam, and additionally:   

* Your piece should be approximately **8-12 minutes in duration**, but of course, this **may vary** depending on your material and your compositional approach and the timing needs of the final concert. It can be a longer excerpt, but not much shorter.  
* Prepare your sketch **in a Reaper session**. Any sound files you use should also be contained inside your Reaper project folder.  
* Sketches should be your own, original work, focusing on your manipulation of the source sounds that interest you.  
* Include **at least 2 source sound files** and/or synthesis clips.  
* Your Reaper project should include a sequence that **utilizes multiple tracks** (recommended: 8).  
* Your Reaper tracks should include **automation**.  
* Make extensive use of SpatGRIS: add ControlGRIS to your tracks and add automation to in order to move your sounds around the space.  
* <strike>The 8-channel space is conceived of as a **ring of 8**, meaning 8 equidistantly-spaced speakers surrounding the audience.</strike>   
* _Due to new restrictions on our final concert, we will make 4-channel pieces instead of 8-channel pieces:_ The 4-channel space is conceived of as a **square**, meaning 4 speakers surrounding the audience in 4 corners of the room.   
* These tracks may include any number of **plugin** devices.  
* If you use plugins, include a **list** of them: _Your mix must be transferrable and able to play on another computer._  
* Strive for **tonal balance in your mix**. For example, use **EQ** and **compression** to improve the interaction between the sounds in your tracks, with special attention to how the sounds change when you apply multichannel spatial movement.   
* Sound files and samples should be exported at a **sample rate of 48 kHz** and a **bit rate of 24 bits** (48 kHz / 24 bits).   

_Note that you're being given the **maximum amount of time to finish your pieces** before they are presented on the concert. Therefore, if your piece is late, unfortunately this will result in a fail._   

_Once the piece has been soundchecked on the performance day, no further revisions or changes can be made before the performance._
